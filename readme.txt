First of all you have to run primary scripts
After you execute all the primary scripts following instructions, you have to create the first set of files
Then only you can run other scripts to create figures

All the scripts should run from inside the files folder

First go to supfig folder
Then go to fig1 folder
Than go to other folders in any order

If there are steps in file names you should run them according to ascending order

e.g step 1, step 2, step 3 etc
